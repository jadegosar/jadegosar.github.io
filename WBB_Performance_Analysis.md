## Project for Women's Basketball Team Performance Analysis

**Project description:**

### 1. Data Description

The data sources used for this project were:

*Catapult Data:* Data from player worn catapult units were the main source of our performance and training load metrics. In the data aggregation process for the Catapult data, we decided to exclude data from game days because these were...

*In-game metrics and player statistics:* To aggregate in-game metrics and important player statistics we used two different data sources. The first data source had advanced statistics generated from a program that the basketball staff utilized to review team and individual performance. The output of this program was PDF files for which I wrote a script that extracted all necessary information and created structured dataframes which held both the individual and team statistics. The second data source used was Sports Reference which is a widely used game statistics database that we used to supplement the team stats we already had available.

*Force Plate Data:* Data was collected from countermovement jumps that were performed on Force Plates throughout the course of the season. While Force Plate metrics were used for some of the analysis on fatigue, they were not used as extensively as the other data sources due to limited testing both in the consistency of the tests across the season and the fact that we only had one season of data to work with.

### 2. Project Process

* Research sports performance related to men's basketball at a collegiate and professional level
* Clean and aggregate Sports Science data sources
* Exploratory data analysis of various data sources and data manipulation
* Regression Model on Wins and Losses
* Cluster Analysis of top 25 teams in the country and PAC12 teams
* Creation of all encompassing Over and Underperformance metric
* Team Catapult Analysis
* Significance Testing on difference in means between Team Catapult metrics based on Performance Metric
* Results and Findings
* Final Applications and presentation to Sports Science and Performance Staff

### 3. Analysis in R Studio

*Cleaning and Aggregating Data Sources*
