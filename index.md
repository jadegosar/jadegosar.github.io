## Sport Science and Performance Analysis Projects

[Boys Academy Soccer Team App](/soccer_app_page.md)

<small>Project completed for Development Academy boys' soccer teams to give the Sports Scientist the ability to visualize game level data based on the team selected. This RShiny App provides the opportunity for the client to look at team level metrics as well as filter for specific player performance. Additionally it provides the distributions of KPIs based on game outcome and
the option to view the underlying dataset based on the applied filters.</small>

[Determining Default Risk for Loan Company](/pdf/Home_Credit_Presentation.pdf)

<small>The objective of this project was to create a supervised analytical model to help Home Credit predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a possible loan, giving them the ability to intervene before borrowers default and reach an underserved population. We developed and tuned a Random Forest model that outperformed the majority classifier, yielding an estimated $505M increase in ROI. The GitHub Repository with more detailed project information can be [found here.](https://github.com/jadegosar/Home_Credit_Default_Risk)</small>
