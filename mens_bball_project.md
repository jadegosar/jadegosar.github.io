## Project for Men's Basketball Team KPI Analysis

**Project description:** This project was completed for a collegiate men's basketball team with the ultimate goal of creating an application or UI that can be used by the Sport Performance team, particularly the Strength and Conditioning coaches. This interface would be used to inform decisions made around athlete injury risk based on fatigue on an individualized basis and if any interventions are needed to the training programs of a particular athlete. The objectives of this project were to make athlete monitoring easier for coaches and other performance staff as well as mitigate injury risk because it will provide a more objective indicator of when an athlete may be fatigued. Additionally this project will allow the performance staff and coaches to better understand the physical toll that practices and games have on the athletes, which in turn can be used to offer advice on how to adjust plans to mitigate athlete injury risk or flag those who might perform under their standard due to fatigue.
